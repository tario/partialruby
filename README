= partialruby - Ruby partial interpreter written in pure ruby

What I trying to say with "partial" ? Well, the ruby interpreter is composed by a few main conceptual "components":  parser, api, VM and execution environment. A partial interpreter will be a library implementing only one or even only part of one of these basic components. 
In this case, partialruby only implements part of the VM (e.g. partialruby DOESN'T implement a GC), use the excenllent ruby_parser gem (https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser) to parse ruby code and use the real interpreter to the rest (api, environment, etc...).

== Goals:

=== Implement a alternative VM which export services that is not exported by the original VM without implementing a entire ruby interpreter or fork an existing ruby interpreter
	- Control of execution flow via hooking for sandboxing (see evalhook and shikashi projects)
	- Fast DSL (over ruby, and faster than ruby itself!)

=== Proof of Concept of interpreter and partial interpreter development

	- Hyper-portability: microruby
	- Search for a faster ruby

== Installation

=== Gem Installation (pending)

sudo gem install partialruby

OR

* Download the last version of the gem from http://github.com/tario/partialruby/downloads
* Install the gem with the following;

sudo gem install partialruby-X.X.X.gem.

== Documentation (pending)

Full API documentation can be found on:
http://tario.github.com/partialruby/doc/

== Usage (pending)

Basically, partialruby export two APIs:

* A alernative eval function with context. Example:

  require "partialruby"
  
  context = PartialRuby::Context.new
  context.eval('print "hello world\n"')

Or

  require "partialruby"
  
  PartialRuby.eval('print "hello world\n"')
  
* A flexible node handling. Example

  require "partialruby"
  
  class MyPartialRubyContext < PartialRuby::Context
  
    def ruby_emul_call(tree,frame)
        object_tree = tree[1]
        method_name = tree[2]

        arglist = tree[3]

        argsstr = arglist[1..-1].
              map{|subtree| "(" +  emul(subtree, frame) + ")" }.
              join(",")


        if (object_tree)
          "((#{emul(object_tree)}).#{method_name}(#{argsstr})"
        else
          if arglist.count == 0
          "#{method_name}(#{argsstr})"
          else
          "#{method_name}"
          end
        end

    end
    
  end
  
  context = MyPartialRubyContext.new
  context.eval('print "hello world\n"')
