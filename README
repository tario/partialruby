= partialruby - Ruby partial interpreter written in pure ruby

What I trying to say with "partial" ? Well, the ruby interpreter is composed by a few main conceptual "components":  parser, api, VM and execution environment. A partial interpreter will be a library implementing only one or even only part of one of these basic components. 
In this case, partialruby only implements part of the VM (e.g. partialruby DOESN'T implement a GC), use the excenllent ruby_parser gem (https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby_parser) to parse ruby code and use the real interpreter to the rest (api, environment, etc...).

== Goals:

=== Implement a alternative VM which export services that is not exported by the original VM without implementing a entire ruby interpreter or fork an existing ruby interpreter
	- Control of execution flow via hooking for sandboxing (see evalhook and shikashi projects)
	- Fast DSL (over ruby, and faster than ruby itself!)

=== Proof of Concept of interpreter and partial interpreter development

	- Hyper-portability: microruby
	- Search for a faster ruby

== Installation
